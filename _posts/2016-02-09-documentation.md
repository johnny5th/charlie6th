## Head First (Vertex) Into Fatherhood

I've always heard of people keeping a diary or writing a blog about their lives. It always sounded really mundane, or filled with incomplete thoughts that would be embarassing to publish or even to read after time passed. Now things are a little different; I've got a son growing in my wife's belly, and things are going to get hilarious. I've already turned into a completely emotional basket-case, a far stride from my previous binary thought processes of bachelorhood, and life's only going to get better.

I hear that parents take an immesurable amount of photos, document funny quips and sayings, and are generally completely annoying with publication of their first child's bowel movements. I figure that I probably won't be any different. Sorry (not sorry, this is payback.)

I should probably unblock those 15 or so friends who have had babies in the past 5 years...
