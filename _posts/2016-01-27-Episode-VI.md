##The Next John Martin

A few weeks into dating Jackie, I informed her that if we were to ever get married, our first son would have to be named John Charles Martin VI. She of course agreed, because duh, that could take a while. Or not.

Jackie and I would like to announce (in the nerdiest way possible, because I'm the web developer) that we are having a little boy this July! Don't worry, to avoid confusion, his nick name will be Charlie (except his grandfather demands to be able to call him "6".)

This site will be the home page of our son, and will be filled with an assortment of beautiful photographs (in an annoying amount), stories, and pleas for babysitting.
