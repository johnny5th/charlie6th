## I felt Charlie kick for the first time!

Jackie and I were laying in bed this morning before getting ready for church and she grabbed my hand and placed it on her stomach "See if you can feel him!" COOLEST THING EVER! He kicked 4-5 times within a minute. "He's a violent little guy."

Jackie's kicking butt with this whole pregnancy thing. Half the time I forget she's even pregnant. I suddenly was reminded "We have a TON of stuff to do to get ready." A crib, dresser, playpen, car seat, stroller, moving my office into the dining room, moving the dining room into the breakfast nook, and setting up the nursery. The list goes on and on, but I couldn't be any happier.
